### Hi there 👋
Hello! My name is Albert Isern Alvarez, and I am a software developer, CEO, and founder of Oxy and co-founder of FairCoin. I live near Barcelona, Spain 🇪🇸, and I have a passion for using technology to make a positive impact on people's lives.

## About Me

I have been working in the software development industry for many years, and I am experienced in a variety of programming languages and technologies. I enjoy learning about new technologies and always strive to improve my skills and knowledge.

- 🌱 I’m constantly learning as I feel this is the right way to do software.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Oxy related projects. I love co-coding. If you feel like working on a issue but need help, ping me up and I'll be glad to help or simply split the work.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with contributions. Open Source is very important and it is often very time consuming free work by a handful of contributors. I would like for those involved frequently into Open Souce contributions to get some financial help from those who need the fixes/features but are not coders. It would help move projects forward much faster. If you like my Open Source work and want to contribute here is my [sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/AlbertIsernAlvarez). Also if you would like to sponsor any specific feature, feel free to reach out, I'll be glad to discuss it.
